(Understand the) Problem
------------------------
-  Inputs: array of strings
-  Output: list of unique elements and a number of occurances for each
---
**Problem Domain:**
  method (array argument), element, count, hash
---
**Implicit Requirements:**
  store element and count in hash
---
**Clarifying Questions:**
1.
2.
3.
---
**Mental Model:**
  Array is passed to the method
  Initialize the count hash
  Iterate through the elements
    If a element is new, create a key and count 1 in the count hash
    If an element is already a key, add 1 to its count
  Print each key and count pair

Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases
----------------------------------
**Examples:**
-  Example 1
  -  Inputs: vehicles = ['car', 'car', 'truck', 'car', 'SUV', 'truck', 'motorcycle', 'motorcycle', 'car', 'truck']
  -  Output:  car => 4
              truck => 3
              SUV => 1
              motorcycle => 2

Algorithm
---------
  START

  # Given array of strings

  SET count hash = {}
  SET iterator = 0

  WHILE iterator < array.size
    IF array[iterator] is a key in count hash add one to its count
    ELSE add the array[iterator] as a key in count hash and add one to its count
    
    SET iterator += 1

  PRINT each key and count pair from count hash

  END
